## Viewing the Dataset
The dataset was curated by me using raw data from the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) system. It contains private identification data about patients in the MGH system, therefore I cannot link the entire dataset. I have provided a brief CSV (```data.csv```) with some sequences so that you can get a idea of what the data looked like. 

## Navigating the Codebase
1. ```Models/``` - Houses all the code for the TF-IDF, ClinicalBERT, and Patient Level models
2. ```Preprocessing/``` - Houses the code for the EHR Preprocessing Pipeline 
3. ```Web-Tool``` - Houses code the NeuraHealth Web Tool

Each folder will also contain a ```README.md``` file that goes into further detail regarding its contents.
